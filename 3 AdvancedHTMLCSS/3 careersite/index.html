    <h1>Physical Therapy: Examine a patient and then create a recovery plan.</h1>
    <h2>Physical therapy falls under the healthcare industry, specifically within the field of rehabilitation medicine.
    </h2>
    <p>I am interested in becoming a physical therapist because I've always wanted to do something in the heathcare industry but I was never sure what. Recently, I've been thinking more about it, and I think I would enjoy being a physical therapist. My friends mom is one and she has told me some things that she does and I belive that I would enjoy it. </p>
