            <h2>All-Star Cheer:</h2>
            <p>All-Star cheer is a club type of cheer, doesn't have anything to do with that school you go to. There are thousands of all-star cheer gyms across the world that compete from November-May. The cheer season starts in June and they practice all summer, then start competing in November. For all-star cheer, each team has one routine that they are working to prefect so they can be the best. There are also multiple different divisions. There is level 1-7 and age groups tiny to open. Open means you can be any age that's over 18. Something else that makes the divisions is the teams have sizes. There is x-small to large teams. Most all-star teams are working towards the same goal which is to win their championship at the ends of the season. For levels 1-5, their championship is called The Summit and takes place in Florida. For levels 6 and 7, their championship is called The Cheerleading Worlds and also takes place in Florida. This is a very hard but fun sport.</p>
