        <h1> Conclusion</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>I bet most of the population doesn't even realize how much
            technology is being used, but all of this information
            shows just how much the use of technology has increased.
            Phone usage aswell as phone ownership has increased, and
            so has the usage and access of internet. Phone usage has increased by 91%, while internet acces has increased by 70%. This proves the large increase in technology in the 2000s.</h3>
        <h3>Take a second to think about your normal day. Do you pick
            up your phone right when you wake up? Is it the last thing
            you touch before you fall asleep? I know that I use my
            phone too much and most of the population could say the
            same thing about themselves.</h3>
