    <h3> Now we are going to get into the specifics. I know most of us depend on our phones on a daily basis for many things like communicating, socializing, and even for safety, but it hasn't always been like that. Phone usage has increased an immense amout over the past years. Americans are spending more time on their phones than ever before, with average daily usage reaching 5 hours and 16 minutes. This represents a significant increase from 4 hours and 37 minutes in 2024, a 14% rise. Gen Z spends the most time on their phones, averaging 6 hours and 27 minutes per day, while Baby Boomers spend a little over 4 hours, still more than double the recommended limit.</h3>
    <h2>Increased Ownership</h2>
    <p>Over the past two decades, phone ownership, particularly smartphone ownership, has skyrocketed, both in the United States and globally. In the US, smartphone penetration has risen dramatically, with 91% of adults owning a smartphone in 2024, up from 35% in 2011.

    <h2> Increased Phone Usage</h2>
    <p>This shift  in ownership is accompanied by a notable increase in time spent on phones, with Americans spending an average of 5 hours and 16 minutes per day. In the first half of 2004, the CDC estimated that only 4.4% of adults relied solely on cellphones and lived in a home without landlines. A recent study found that, on average, children get their first phone at age 12. That means that the average American is expected to spend approximately 12 years of their life looking at their phone. More than half of Americans believe they are too dependent on their phones (52%). As many as 3 in 5 (59%) use their phones on the toilet, while 27% will text when at stoplights.</p>
