    <h1>Internet Access Over Time</h1>
    <img class="phone" src ="internet top.jpg" alt="internet">
    <h3>Now we are going to get into another technology adoption. Internet access refers to the ability to connect a device, like a computer or smartphone, to the internet, enabling users to access various online services and applications. This access is typically provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and involves using technologies like Wi-Fi, ethernet, or cellular networks. While people are at home or out in public, they often are worrying about trying to connect their smart devices to the internet. Since people rely so much on their devices in our society today, internet is a very important part of our world.</h3>
    <h2> Increased Internet Access</h2>
    <p>Over the last 20 years, internet access in the United States has grown dramatically, from about 50% of adults being online in 2000 to nearly 95% today. This growth has been accompanied by significant changes in how people use the internet, with mobile devices becoming the primary means of access. In the early 2000s, the internet was very slow. A simple website without animation could take up to a minute to load and you had to wait all night to download a movie. A few words about browsers in the 2000s. There were no tabs. You had to open a new window for each website. It was hardly possible to open a dozen sites at once, considering the RAM size of those computers. On the other hand, the developers did not have to think about responsive design and other complicated things. All users surfed the web from monitors with the same screen resolution. You can still feel how internet surfing was back in the early 2000s. Go to OldWeb.Today, choose any browser emulator and type a familiar URL, such as apple.com or google.com. You can try to open a present-day website with this tool, but you probably wonâ€™t succeed. </p>
