        <p style="background-color: aqua;">  Dolphins frequently ride on the bow waves or the stern wakes of boats. This activity is probably adapted from the natural behavior of riding ocean swells, the wakes of large whales, or a mother dolphin's slip stream (hydrodynamic wake).

            Dolphins have been seen jumping as high as 4.9 m (16 ft) from the surface of the water and landing on their backs, bellies, or sides in a behavior called a breach.
            
            Both young and old dolphins chase one another, carry objects around, toss seaweed to each other, and use objects to solicit interaction. Such activity may be practice for catching food.
            
            At SeaWorld, dolphins have been observed using objects like fish in seemingly playful ways. They even use air forced out of their blowholes as a form of play.  A young bottlenose dolphin at Dolphin Cove has learned how to create and control bubble rings of air to play with.
