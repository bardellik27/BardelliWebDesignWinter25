    <br>
    <p style="background-color: lightyellow;"> Hello everyone! My name is Katelyn Bardelli and I am 15 years old. My favorite hobby is cheerleading. I have been
        cheering since I was 4 years old. I am very quiet when you first meet me but with my close friends and family I
        am a fun and loud person. I am also very trustworthy. A lot of people tell me everything because they know and
        trust that I will help them and not tell anyone if they don't want me too. This is also because I am a good
        listener. Outside of cheer, I enjoy reading, hanging out with friends, and taking naps. My goals for highschool
        is to win a cheerleading state championship, continue to recieve all A's and a average of a 4.65 GPA, and to
        make more friends and closer connections with my teachers. After highschool, I want to go to college at Michigan
        but if I don't get in or if I decide I want to cheer in college I want to go to Davenport University. I want to
        be something in the medical field but I'm not sure exactly what yet.</p>
