        <h2><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></h2>
        </p>
        <p>Dolphins are highly <b>intelligent</b> marine mammals and are part of the family of <b>toothed whales</b>
            that include orcas and pilot whales. They <b>must surface</b> to breathe air and give birth to live young.
            They are found <b>worldwide</b>, mostly in shallow seas of the continental shelves, and are
            <b>carnivores</b>, mostly eating fish and squid. Dolphin coloration varies, but they are generally <b>gray
            </b>in color with darker backs than the rest of their bodies. Currently around <b>40 species</b> of dolphins
            have been recorded living in the ocean. Unlike some whale species, dolphins are not known for making long
            migration trips. Some species will migrate due to seasonal changes, but they don’t travel nearly as far as
            some whales do. Dolphins have an array of <b>vocalisations</b> such as clicks, whistles and squeals which
            they use for their well-developed communication and echolocation skills.

        <h2><strong><em>Behavior</em></strong></h2>
        </p>
        <p>Dolphins are well known for their <b>agility and playful</b> behavior, making them a favorite of wildlife
            watchers. Many species will conserve energy by swimming alongside ships, a practice known as
            <b>bow-riding</b>. Dolphins also <b>leap out of the water, spy-hop, and follow ships</b>, often
            synchronizing their movements with one another. Dolphins live in <b>social groups of five to several
                hundred</b>. They use <b>echolocation</b> to find prey and often hunt together by surrounding a school
            of fish, trapping them and taking turns swimming through the resulting <b>“bait ball”</b> to catch fish.
            Dolphins will also follow seabirds, other whales and fishing boats to feed opportunistically on the fish
            they scare up or discard. Dolphins have also been known to help an injured dolphin by pushing it to the
            surface so it can breathe. Dolphins eat fish, squid and crustaceans. They <b>do not chew their food</b> but
            may break it into smaller pieces before swallowing.

        <h2><strong><em>Lifespan and Reproduction</em></strong></h2>
        </p>
        <p>Bottlenose dolphins can live at least <b>40 years</b>, with some <b>females outliving males at 60 years or
                more</b>. They generally begin to reproduce when they are between 5 and 15 years old, with the exact age
            varying by population. Female bottlenose dolphins can reach sexual maturity before males. Females are
            <b>pregnant for about 12 months</b> and give birth, on average, <b>every 3 to 6 years</b>. Once calves are
            born, they <b>nurse for 20 months</b> or so and generally <b>stay with their mothers for 3 to 6 years</b>.
            Females as old as 45 have given birth. Bottlenose dolphins may breed throughout the year. However, certain
            breeding seasons have been observed and <b>vary with location</b>. Breeding seasons generally <b>coincide
                with calving seasons</b> Male and female bottlenose dolphins have <b>multiple mates</b> in a given
            reproductive season..
